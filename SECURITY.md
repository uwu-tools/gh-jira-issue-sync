## Reporting a Vulnerability

**_Due to their public nature, GitHub issue trackers are not appropriate places
for reporting vulnerabilities._**

This project uses GitHub's private vulnerability reporting to triage and
remediate potential security issues.

To learn more about the private vulnerability reporting process, read GitHub's
docs [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
