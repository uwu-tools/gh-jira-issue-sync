`gh-jira-issue-sync` is a tool for mirroring GitHub issues in Jira. It grew out
of a desire to maintain a public GitHub repo while tracking private issues in a
Jira board; rather than require people to keep up with both sources, we decided
to make *one* the single source of truth.

_Note that `gh-jira-issue-sync` works only one way and will **NOT** mirror
issues from Jira to GitHub._

## Usage

### Jira Configuration

To use, first ensure you have a Jira server with the project you want
to track on it - it can be a cloud account, or self-hosted. Also make
sure you have a user account that can access the project and create
issues on it; it's recommended that you create an account specifically
for the tool.

The following custom fields must be configured AND associated to the
appropriate project's screens:

| Custom Field Name | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `github-id` | Number |
| `github-number` | Number |
| `github-status` | Short text (plain text only) |
| `github-reporter` | Short text (plain text only) |
| `github-labels` | Labels |
| `github-last-sync` | Date Time Picker |

If you intend to use OAuth with Jira, you must create an inbound
application connection and add a public key. Instructions can be found
in
[OAuth for Rest APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-rest-api-oauth-authentication/).

### Application Configuration

Arguments to the program may be passed on the command line or in a configuration file.
Currently supported configuration file types are: JSON, YAML, TOML.

For the command line arguments, run:

```console
gh-jira-issue-sync help
```

The configuration is a single, flat object, with the argument long
names as keys.

Configuration arguments are as follows:

| Name | Value Type | Example Value | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| log-level | string | "warn" | false | "info" |
| confirm | bool | false | false | false |
| github-token | string | | true | null |
| jira-user | string | "user@jira.example.com" | false | null |
| jira-pass | string | | false | null |
| jira-token | string | | false | null |
| jira-secret | string | | false | null |
| jira-consumer-key | string | | false | null |
| jira-private-key-path | string | | false | null |
| repo-name | string | "uwu-tools/gh-jira-issue-sync" | true | null |
| jira-uri | string | "https://jira.example.com" | true | null |
| jira-project | string | "SYNC" | true | null |
| jira-components | []string | ["Core","Payment"] | false | null |
| since | string | "2017-07-01T13:45:00-0800" | false | "1970-01-01T00:00:00+0000" |
| timeout | duration | 500ms | false | 1m |

### Configuration Key Descriptions

`log-level` is the minimum level which will be logged; any output below
this value will be discarded.

`confirm` is for confirming a production run, it must be explicitly set 
to `true`, otherwise it will be a dry run by default and no changes 
will be executed in Jira

`github-token` is a personal access token used to access GitHub as a
specific user.

`jira-user` and `jira-pass` are the username (i.e. email) and password
of the Jira user which will be authenticated. See `Authentication` for
more details.

`jira-token` and `jira-secret` are OAuth access tokens which will be
used to perform an OAuth connection to Jira. `jira-consumer-key` and
`jira-private-key-path` are the RSA key used for OAuth. See
`Authentication` for more details.

`repo-name` is the GitHub repo from which issues will be retrieved. It
must be in the form `owner/repo`, for example `uwu-tools/gh-jira-issue-sync`.

`jira-uri` is the base URL of the Jira instance. If the Jira instance
lives at a non-root URL, the path must be included. For example,
`https://example.com/jira`.

`jira-project` is the key (not the name) of the project in Jira to
which the issues will be synchronized.

`jira-components` is the names of the components in Jira 
that will be added to the issues when synchronized. If a component 
not found on the project or the set value is otherwise invalid, 
an error will return. (optional)

`since` is the cutoff date issue-sync will use when searching for issues
to synchronize. If an issue was last updated before this time, it will
not be synchronized. Usually this is the last run of the tool. It is in
ISO-8601 format.

`timeout` represents the duration of time for which an API request will
be retried in case of failure. Human-friendly strings such as `30s` are
accepted as input, although the application will save it to the file
in a number of nanoseconds.

### Configuration File

By default, gh-jira-issue-sync looks for the configuration file at
`$PWD/.issue-sync.json`. To override this location, use the `--config`
option on the command line.

If both a configuration file and command line arguments are provided,
the command line arguments override the configuration file.

After a successful run, the current configuration, with command line
arguments overwritten, is saved to the configuration file (either the
one provided, or `$PWD/.issue-sync.json`); the "since" date is updated
to the current date when the tool is run, as well.

### Authentication

If `jira-user` or `jira-pass` are provided, both are required, and the
application will connect to Jira via Basic Authentication.

Otherwise, OAuth will be used. In this case, the `jira-consumer-key`, which is the
name of the RSA public key on the Jira server, and the
`jira-private-key`, which is the path to the RSA private key which
matches, must be provided.

If the `jira-token` and `jira-secret` are provided, they are used as the
OAuth access token.

If they are not provided, an OAuth handshake occurs, and an authorization
URL will be given. The user will need to open the URL in their browser,
and receive the authorization code provided. Once the code is entered
into the application, an access token will be generated, and it will be
added to the configuration for future use.
